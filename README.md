# Infinite pyStream

This algorithm is a Moore Neighborhood pattern finder. The program searches within any file to find the largest region of adjacent bits.

The program regionIdentifier.py takes a file as its argument. Additionally you can set the number of columns per row with the optional **--columns** argument.

Furthermore, the program utilizes threading for a non-blocking io stream.
